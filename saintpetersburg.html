		<h1>Saint Petersburg</h1>
		<h2>About</h2>

		<p>Known as Russia's cultural capital, Saint Petersburg is famous for its history, art, music, ballet and just about any other cultural thing you can think of!  But that's not all this beautiful city has to offer.  Hidden behind its grand cathedrals, imperial palaces and world-famous museums, Saint Petersburg has a substantial underground scene.  Cafes, bars, clubs - Saint Petersburg has a wealth of alternative culture that will bring something new and exciting to your holiday.</p>

		<h2>Places to go</h2>

		<h3>Loft Project ETAGI</h3>

		<p>Situated in a converted Soviet apartment block, the Loft Project ETAGI is a contemporary art space in the heart of the city.  Alongside art exhibtions, you can find vintage shops, vegan restaurants and roof-top bars.
