		<h1>Saint Petersburg</h1>
		<h2>About</h2>

		<img src="./images/Saintpetersburgmain.jpg">

		<p>Known as Russia's cultural capital, Saint Petersburg is famous for its history, art, music, ballet and just about any other cultural thing you can think of!  But that's not all this beautiful city has to offer.  Hidden behind its grand cathedrals, imperial palaces and world-famous museums, Saint Petersburg has a substantial underground scene.  Cafes, bars, clubs - Saint Petersburg has a wealth of alternative culture that will bring something new and exciting to your holiday.</p>

		<h2>Places to go</h2>

		<p>Ever wondered what it is like to drink tea in a palace before?  Well, in Saint Petersburg, you can do just that!  Anticafe FREEDOM is located in a converted palace just off the city's main street, Nevsky Prospect. It features many rooms you can relax, such as a library, a games room and a chill-out area.  The grand reception room, home to a white grand piano, is also available to hire for elaborate functions and parties. Aside from this cafe's brilliant location, it is also different in other ways.  Guests pay for every minute of time spent in the cafe, rather than for what they buy.  THis means that you can help yourself to limitless tea, coffee and biscuits all day long!</p>

		<h3>Club-Bar Bermudy</h3>

Situated just off the central Sadovaya Street, Bermudy has a friendly atmosphere, great music and an all-important table football.  At weekends, this bar-club is crowded by locals and foreign visitors looking to dance the night away to 60s music, Russian pop, and the charts.</p>
